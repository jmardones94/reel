# Reel
This was a one-week project developed while attending MindHub course on Full Stack MERN & Mobile Apps.
The main purpose of this project was to develop a server with template engine and server side rendering, to contrast with API REST-like server working with React.

### Main technologies
I used NodeJS with Express, MongoDB as a database in the master branch and MySQL in another branch as an alternative, Pug as template Engine, TailwindCSS for the styles. The session is persisted with express-session and storaged in the database with 'connect-mongodb-session' ('connect-session-sequelize' in the SQL version).

You can see the MongoDB-version hosted on Heroku [here](https://reel-reviews.herokuapp.com/).
